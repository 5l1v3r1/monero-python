Python module for Monero -- docs
================================================

Welcome to the documentation for the `monero` Python module.

The aim of this project is to offer a set of tools for interacting with Monero
cryptocurrency in Python. It provides higher level classes representing objects
from the Monero environment, like wallets, accounts, addresses, transactions.

Currently it operates over JSON RPC protocol, however other backends are
planned as well.
